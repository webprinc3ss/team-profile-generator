  ## Description
  The Porfolio Generator is a Nodejs app to assist managers on creating a team webpage via the terminal command-line.

  This application is created in Nodejs with the npm Inquirer, npm Validate and fs.write packages.

  Inquirer is used to prompt questions for the user which is then written, using the fs.write module, to a template which prints out the HTML file.

  Bootstrap was used in the styling of this project: https://getbootstrap.com/
